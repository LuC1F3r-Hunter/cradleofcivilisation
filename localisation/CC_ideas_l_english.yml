  ### Iran
 PER_oil_concessions:0 "The 1933 Oil Concession"
 PER_oil_concessions_desc:0 "Although we have lots of oil reserves in theory, in reality we get little of our petroleum. In 1933, Reza Shah signed an oil concession granting the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company a stranglehold on our oil, taking much for themselves at the cost of our nation. It must take drastic action to kill off British drilling and nationalize the oil reserves."
 PER_you_are_corrupt_congrats:0 "Corrupt Army and Nation"
 PER_you_are_corrupt_congrats_desc:0 "Although the Shah strives to modernize the nation, it is still corrupt, especially in the army. Stacked with old guard cavalry officials, it stands as both underequipped and poorly managed aside from a few competent commanders. While the fear of rebellion still looms strong over Iran, surely that risk isn't worth the state of the army."
 PER_ploopy_economy:0 "Obsolete Economy"
 PER_ploopy_economy_desc:0 "At the moment, Iran's economy revolves around a mix of incompetently managed foregin businesses, such as the British Anglo-Iranian oil company, and increasingly regulated and rebellious fuedal lords emulating the ways of old. This, alongside a largely medieval, farm-based, and illiterate populace gives Iran a major economic deficit."
 PER_you_are_unpopular:0 "Unruly Populace"
 PER_you_are_unpopular_desc:0 "A good majority of the people of Iran, whether intellectual or commoner, have anti-government views. Communists, democrats, rival factions of monarchists and tribal loyalists all stand in opposition to the central government in Tehran. While our Shah has quelled their more revolutionary tendancies through constant purges, there are discontented elements waiting to pounce."
 PER_the_clergy_hate_you:0 "Hostile Clergy"
 PER_the_clergy_hate_you_desc:0 "Ever since the Arab invasion introduced Islam to Iran, the clergy, represented by radical mullahs and black-turbaned seyyeds, have held a grip on the public conciousness. Most of our nation is deeply religous, and can be easily swayed by demagouges of that nature. Sadly, they are increasingly using this power to protest Reza Shah's regime."
 POLITICS_REZA_SHAH_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "Reza Shah Pahlavi was born a peasent on the 15th of March, 1878. He joined the army, and quickly rose through the ranks thanks to his proficience with machine guns.\n\nEventually, in the turmoil of the First World War he staged a coup against the old and incompetent Qajar dynasty, effectively becoming Iran's strongman as War Minister and later Prime Minister, and after a brief interregnum, siezed the throne and has been ruling ever since.\n\nHe is a popular figurehead among the army thanks to this, and his looming presence and threat of purges has kept dissent under wraps for now. Today Reza, albeit more paranoid and ruthless then his young self, still aims to modernize and improve Iran. Ey Iran!"
