 PER_oil_concessions_desc:0 "Although we have lots of oil reserves in theory, in reality we get little of our petroleum. The British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has a stranglehold on our oil, taking much for themselves at the cost of our nation. It must take drastic action to kill off British drilling and nationalize the oil reserves."
