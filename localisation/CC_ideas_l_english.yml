 PER_oil_concessions:0 "The 1933 Oil Concession"
 PER_oil_concessions_desc:0 "Although we have lots of oil reserves in theory, in reality we get little of our petroleum. In 1933, Reza Shah signed an oil concession granting the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company a stranglehold on our oil, taking much for themselves at the cost of our nation. It must take drastic action to kill off British drilling and nationalize the oil reserves."
 PER_you_are_corrupt_congrats:0 "Corrupt Army and Nation"
 PER_you_are_corrupt_congrats_desc:0 "Although the Shah strives to modernize the nation, it is still corrupt, especially in the army. Stacked with old guard cavalry officials, it stands as both underequipped and poorly managed aside from a few competent commanders. While the fear of rebellion still looms strong over Iran, surely that risk isn't worth the state of the army."
 PER_your_economy_sucks:0 "Obsolete Economy"
 PER_your_economy_sucks_desc:0 "At the moment, Iran's economy revolves around a mix of incompetently managed foregin businesses, such as the British Anglo-Iranian oil company, and increasingly regulated and rebellious fuedal lords emulating the ways of old. This, alongside a largely medieval, farm-based, and illiterate populace gives Iran a major economic deficit.
 PER_you_are_unpopular:0 "Unruly Populace"
 PER_you_are_unpopular_desc:0 "A good majority of the people of Iran, whether intellectual or commoner, have anti-government views. Communists, democrats, rival factions of monarchists and tribal loyalists all stand in opposition to the central government in Tehran. While our Shah has quelled their more revolutionary tendancies through constant purges, there are discontented elements waiting to pounce."
 PER_the_clergy_hate_you:0 "Hostile Clergy"
 PER_the_clergy_hate_you_desc:0 "Ever since the Arab invasion introduced Islam to Iran, the clergy, represented by radical mullahs and black-turbaned seyyeds, have held a grip on the public conciousness. Most of our nation is deeply religous, and can be easily swayed by demagouges of that nature. Sadly, they are increasingly using this power to protest Reza Shah's regime."
 POLITICS_REZA_SHAH_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "Our Shah started off a common soldier, a cavalry commander who staged a coup against the old Qajar dynasty in 1921, and after a brief interregnum, has been ruling ever since. He is a popular figurehead among the army thanks to this, and his looming presence and threat of purges has kept dissent under wraps, for now."
 YEM_debt_0:0 "Zero Debt"
 YEM_debt_0_desc:0 "Our country has paid off all of our loans. There is no need to repay them."
 YEM_debt_1:0 "Low Debt"
 YEM_debt_1_desc:0 "Economists have noted a slight increase of national debt. We should not forget about this."
 YEM_debt_2:0 "Average Debt"
 YEM_debt_2_desc:0 "Our debt is average and not too high that it can't be fixed. We should repay them before it is too late."
 YEM_debt_3:0 "Intermediate Debt"
 YEM_debt_3_desc:0 "Our debt is yet incrasing at a faster pace. It is advised that we begin to repay our loans to prevent the debt from becoming too much."
 YEM_debt_4:0 "High Debt"
 YEM_debt_4_desc:0 "Our debt is now higher than our country can handle. It is becoming a burden on the country and increasing dissent. It is extremely advised that we prevent it from going any higher."
 YEM_debt_5:0 "Crippling Debt"
 YEM_debt_5_desc:0 "Years of not paying off our loans have caused our debt to soar. People are questioning the legitimacy of the government to control this issue. We really have to cut budgets to cut down on this major national issue."
 YEM_family_struggle:0 "Family Struggles"
 YEM_family_struggle_desc:0 "Unfortunately for every kingdom, there is struggle from within. The Imam's unwillingness to name a successor has already destabilzed the country. If we wish to prevent this from happening, reforms need to be passed."
 YEM_propagate_zaydi:0 "Propagate Zaydi Islam"
 YEM_propagate_zaydi_desc:0 "We are propagating the true form of Islam, the school of Zaydi. Although this takes a toll on our stability, conversion to this school of thought will prove beneficial in the long run."
 YEM_pastoralism:0 "Pastoral Society"
 YEM_pastoralism_desc:0 "Yemen is stuck in the days of old. Little to no people work in factories and the majority population remains agrarian. This takes a toll on our industrial output, and further industrial reform is needed to solve the issue."
 YEM_army:0 "Inexperienced Army"
 YEM_army_desc:0 "Yemen has a major issue with it's army. Incompetency is rife, and methods outdated. The condition of our military dwindled even further after we lost the 1934 Saudi War. If we want to protect ourselves, we must fix the army first."
