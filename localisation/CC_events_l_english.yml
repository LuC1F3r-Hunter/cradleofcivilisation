 turkey.1.t:0 "Reza Shah Dies"
 turkey.1.d:0 "Today is certainly a sad day for the Iranian people. The Great Reza Shah Pahlavi, father of modern Iran was found dead from a heart attack this morning. Although his claim to the throne came about as the result of a coup, he tried his best to serve Iran until his final breath. He will be buried in his hometown of Alasht, grouped together with Tehran to form province 2 under his expert hand. As is tradition in monarchy, he will be suceeded by his 25 year old son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. A captain in the army, Mohammad Reza seems enthusiastic to follow in his father's footsteps."
 turkey.1.a:0 "Let's hope he carries on the Shah's legacy."
